**Your app’s name**: picnic

A user can sign into the Picnic app to create a basket of food they would like to donate to someone in their local area. Guests will be able to view a list of all available baskets on the platform. Guests will see a photo of all baskets and the city location of all baskets as well. If you’d like to inquire about receiving a basket or creating your own basket, you’re required to sign up for an account and log into your Picnic account first. Once logged into your Picnic account, users can see a list of all basket cards on the user homepage. Each card displays a photo of the basket, a description of items included in the basket, the creator’s email address so you can contact them, city location of the basket, and a comments section so you can ask questions on each basket. As a user, you can see all available baskets created on the app, but you have the ability to edit/remove only the baskets you create.
